Leetcode: 162 FInd Peak element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + ((right - left) >>2);

            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                // The peak element is in the left half
                right = mid;
            } else {
                // The peak element is in the right half
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
